# MentraOS SDK Reference

Welcome to the reference for the MentraOS SDK. This section provides detailed information about all classes, interfaces, types, and enums available in the `@mentra/sdk` package.

## Overview

The MentraOS SDK is organized into several main components:

* **Primary Classes**: Core classes like [`AppServer`](/reference/app-server) and [`AppSession`](/reference/app-session) that serve as the main entry points for app development
* **Manager Classes**: Component classes like [`EventManager`](/reference/managers/event-manager), [`LayoutManager`](/reference/managers/layout-manager), and [`SettingsManager`](/reference/managers/settings-manager) that handle specific functionalities
* **Enums**: Enumeration types that define constants and options throughout the SDK
* **Interfaces**: Type definitions for configuration objects, events, layouts, settings, and messages
* **Utilities**: Helper functions and utility classes
