# Photo Capture Guide

This guide covers how to capture photos from smart glasses using the MentraOS Camera Module.

## Overview

Photo capture allows your app to request individual photos from connected smart glasses. This is perfect for:

* Documentation and note-taking apps
* Visual assistance applications
* Inventory management
* Social sharing features
* Accessibility tools

## Permissions Required

Before using photo capture, your app must have the `CAMERA` permission:

**Add to App Manifest**: Include `CAMERA` in your app's permissions in the [Developer Console](https://console.mentra.glass/)

For complete permission setup instructions, see the [Permissions Guide](/permissions).

## Basic Usage

### Simple Photo Capture

```typescript
// Request a photo from the smart glasses
const photo = await session.camera.requestPhoto()

console.log(`Photo captured: ${photo.filename}`)
console.log(`Size: ${photo.size} bytes`)
console.log(`Type: ${photo.mimeType}`)
```

### Requesting Photo Size

Apps can request the desired photo size. Supported values are `small`, `medium` (default), and `large`. Small photos are faster to capture and transfer, but have lower resolution. Large photos are slower to capture and transfer, but have higher resolution.

```typescript
// Small, faster capture/transfer
const small = await session.camera.requestPhoto({size: "small"})

// Default medium
const medium = await session.camera.requestPhoto() // or { size: 'medium' }

// Large, highest available resolution
const large = await session.camera.requestPhoto({size: "large"})
```

### Working with Photo Data

The photo is returned as a `Buffer` object. Here are common ways to use it:

```typescript
private async processPhoto(session: AppSession): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const photo = await session.camera.requestPhoto();

    // Convert to base64 for storage or transmission
    const base64String = photo.buffer.toString('base64');
    session.logger.info(`Photo as base64 (first 50 chars): ${base64String.substring(0, 50)}...`);

    // Save to file (Node.js)
    import fs from 'fs';
    const filename = `photo_${Date.now()}.jpg`;
    fs.writeFileSync(filename, photo.buffer);
    session.logger.info(`Photo saved to file: ${filename}`);

    // Send to external API
    await this.uploadPhotoToAPI(photo.buffer, photo.mimeType);
  } catch (error) {
    session.logger.error('Failed to process photo:', error);
  }
}

private async uploadPhotoToAPI(buffer: Buffer, mimeType: string): Promise<void> {
  // Example: Upload to your backend API
  // const formData = new FormData();
  // formData.append('photo', new Blob([buffer], { type: mimeType }));
  // await fetch('/api/upload', { method: 'POST', body: formData });
}
```
